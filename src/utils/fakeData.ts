  "3 years ago, while organizing my suitcases to go on family vacation, I noticed that my bathroom was full of hygiene & care products of all kinds: micellar water, cleansing milk, eye makeup remover, facial cleanser, shaving cream, facial moisturizer, aftershave gel, body cream, women's deodorant, men's deodorant, shower gel, kids shower gel, shampoo, kids shampoo, conditioner, hair conditioner, hair mask... The observation is alarming: we We use similar cosmetic products on a daily basis, bulky, composed of 80 to 85% water, contained in bulky and polluting plastic bottles. Each cosmetic with its function and/or target considerably multiplies our consumption and waste. At that precise moment, I imagined creating a reasonable and responsible range, suitable for the whole family. Solid products for easy, portable and economical use; minimalist formulas without water and therefore without preservatives for more concentrated and healthy cosmetics; with natural and mainly local ingredients while respecting the environment. The adventure began in November 2019, with the creation of the Nature Féerique brand identity, its registration then the meeting with the suppliers supporting the project. Two years later, from the search for the best ingredients, mainly local, to the development of formulas, including tests and adjustments to find the ideal texture, Nature Féerique is proud to unveil these first 3 cosmetic products: - Plume Deodorant, a treatment solid natural deodorant - Cocoon Make-up Remover, a 2-in-1 solid oil: cleanser and make-up remover - Soin Précieux, a multi-use solid cream Nature Féerique had the privilege of promoting the launch of these solid cosmetics at the Artisan Counter in the store alinea Avignon-Le Pontet, new ephemeral place for exchanges and sharing from the alinea brand. In its approach, Nature Féerique is committed to supporting families towards a minimalist beauty routine and more responsible cosmetic consumption.",
